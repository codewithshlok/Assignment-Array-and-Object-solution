// Q3. Object Extensibility and Sealing
// a) Use the Object.preventEatensions method to prevent any further additions of properties to the studet object.
// b) Use the Object.isEatensible method to check if the student object is extensible. Store the result in a variable
// called extensibleStatus.
// c) Create a new object called teacher with a 'subject' property set to 'Math'.
// d) Use the Object.seal method to seal the teacher object, preventing any additions or deletions of properties.
// e) Use the Object.isSealed method to check if the teacher object is sealed. Store the result in a variable called
// sealedStatus.
// f) Print the extensibleStatus any sealedStatus to the console.

// a) Use the Object.preventExtensions method to prevent any further additions of properties to the student object.
const student = {
    name: "John",
    age: 20
  };
  Object.preventExtensions(student);
  
  // b) Use the Object.isExtensible method to check if the student object is extensible. Store the result in a variable called extensibleStatus.
  const extensibleStatus = Object.isExtensible(student);
  
  // c) Create a new object called teacher with a 'subject' property set to 'Math'.
  const teacher = {
    subject: 'Math'
  };
  
  // d) Use the Object.seal method to seal the teacher object, preventing any additions or deletions of properties.
  Object.seal(teacher);
  
  // e) Use the Object.isSealed method to check if the teacher object is sealed. Store the result in a variable called sealedStatus.
  const sealedStatus = Object.isSealed(teacher);
  
  // f) Print the extensibleStatus and sealedStatus to the console.
  console.log("Extensible status of student:", extensibleStatus);
  console.log("Sealed status of teacher:", sealedStatus);
